I ran each of these programs with node from my terminal with the following commands:

node Assignment1.js
node Assignment2.js
node Assignment3.js

For Assignment1 I created an array to test my functions and will print the largest difference between two numbers in that array.

For Assignment2 line 62 contains the rectangles being compared ex: 
rectangles(rect1, rect2)

The rectangles given in the assignment are within the code and can be tested by changing line 62. 

For Assignment3, running the code will give the answer to the number given (667734139064).
